# Debugging

1. When running any of the .py files, if `os.getenv` doesn't seem to work, just copy the variables from your .env file to the program file itself.
2. Make sure you're using python3 (preferably python 3.10.5)
3. While installing `python-telegram-bot`, use `pip install python-telegram-bot -U --pre` since we are using version 20.x which is still in pre-release mode. Some of the features won't be available in the 13.x version.
